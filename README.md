# Computer Vision RPS



Milestone 1

In this milestone I had the simple task of creating a new repository for the Computer Vision Project. I will save all the relevant folders and work for this project on the repository. The advantage of using a Repository is because it allows us to to save various versions of the project and creates a mind map of the progress of the project until it is completed. Repositorires also allow me to share my current work with the public and allows other colleagues to access and make changes to improve the code with my permission.

To achieve this I had to use Teachable-Machine  to start creating the model. Each class is trained with images of yourself showing each option to the camera. The "Nothing" class represents the lack of option in the image. Remember that the more images you train with, the more accurate the model will be
